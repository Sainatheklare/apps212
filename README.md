Arkane Pvt Limited is using Cloud for one of their products. The project is in its initial stages, and
the organization is ready with its frontend. However, it is taking about 4 hours of effort to push
each update to its production environment, which is an obstacle for the release of the product.
To resolve this issue, the team has decided to containerize their application to ease the
deployment process.
